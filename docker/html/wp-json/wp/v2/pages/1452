What dynamics shape literary transfer from Flanders to the English-speaking world? How are the relative positions and position-takings of source and target producers ordered? What is the structure of the \u2018transnational literary field\u2019 in which these works are produced? What mediating positions does the Flemish Literature Fund and its representatives take up in this field? How do international book fairs like the London Book Fair and the <em>Frankfurter Buchmesse<\/em> shape it? Taking \u2018Flanders\u2019 (e.g. the Flemish Literature Fund in its state-sanctioned role as transnational mediator) as a case study, the project aims to contribute to ongoing discussions about how works from smaller European literatures cross national borders, how state agents act in a globalized book market characterised by increasing economic constraints, how books by Flemish authors enter English-language fields, and how translation into English affects a work\u2019s later production and reception trajectory, both in terms of new translations in third languages and feed-back effects at home.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.codl.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/photorobjack.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-1556 size-thumbnail\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/www.codl.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/photorobjack-137x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"137\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>&#8216;Boek to Book&#8217; is a four-year doctoral research project and is being carried out by <strong>Jack McMartin<\/strong> under the supervision of Elke Brems.
