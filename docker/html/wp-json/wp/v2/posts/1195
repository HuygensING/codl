This was\u00a0even truer around 1900. Although a great many Dutch with a certain level of education\u00a0spoke French, they lacked the network, the authority, and perhaps also the motivation\u00a0needed to put their mastery of the language to use and introduce or spread Dutch\u00a0literature in France.<\/p>\n<p>On the other side, Dutch-speaking French were hard to come by. Still, the French\u00a0literary climate of those years displayed an interest in foreign literature. Couperus\u00a0benefits from this: translations of his writings are published both in magazines and as\u00a0books, and in addition to these, untranslated works of his, among which De Stille Kracht\u00a0(The Hidden Force), are commented upon by the press. There is some interest for the\u00a0writer as a person as well. His death in 1923 seems to mark a change that will result in the opposite situation, where a few translations are still being published, but do not get\u00a0discussed at all, except in their paratexts.<\/p>\n<p>This talk will give an overview of the spreading and reception of Couperus\u2019 writings\u00a0in France, concentrating on De Stille Kracht. It will analyse the role of the various\u00a0mediators and of course, pay attention to the part Couperus himself may have played in<br \/>\nthis spreading as well. As a conclusion, I will try to offer an explanation for the silent\u00a0death this reception has died.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Chiara Beltrami Gottmer (University of Amsterdam) Lucifer in the Sawah<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Panel 5B (English): The Splendour of Vondel\u2019s Lucifer 1654-2015: canonicity, cultural memory and cultural\u00a0transfer<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In Dutch East India Lucifer was actualized and frequently declaimed in Dutch for\u00a0entertaining the Dutch community. In official celebrations of the \u2018cultural icon\u2019 Vondel,\u00a0which were realised with the aid of both academics and professional actors, recitation\u00a0was consistently reduced to the choruses. All of these acts of remembrance were kept\u00a0well away from the indigenous cultural spheres. However, a recently rediscovered\u00a0Javanese adaptation indicates that the play also has been accommodated to local<br \/>\ncultures of the \u2018sawah\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pieter Boulogne (University of Leuven \/ University of Antwerp) Minoes als Russische\u00a0femme fatale<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Panel 5A (Dutch): The reception of Annie M.G. Schmidts Minoes in Central and Eastern Europe<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After a literary-historical reflection on the non-reception of Annie MG Schmidt in Soviet\u00a0Russia, the latest edition of the Russian translation Murli (1997) will be analyzed, with\u00a0particular attention to the dilemma naturalization-exotization. The illustrations by<br \/>\nSokolov, showing a Murli with diva-airs, are scrutinized. The adaptations seem to make\u00a0the text more suitable for a Russian-style socialization. Finally, Murli\u2019s popularity with\u00a0the general Russian public will be assessed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Elke Brems (University of Leuven), St\u00e9phanie Vanasten (UCL) &amp; Pieter Boulogne\u00a0(University of Leuven \/ University of Antwerp) The novel De helaasheid der dingen\u00a0as a film (in translation): some methodological considerations<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Panel 4B (English)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The work of the Flemish writer Dimitri Verhulst, and especially his novel De helaasheid\u00a0der dingen (2006), crosses the cultural and linguistic borders with ease and readily\u00a0allows for translation, adaptation and acculturation. This contribution focuses on a few<br \/>\nof the different locations of the novel: Flanders and the \u00a0Netherlands, France and French-speaking Belgium and Russia and the various forms that the text assumes via e.g.\u00a0criticism, translation, and especially film. As Rigney says, we want to look at \u2018texts across\u00a0time, but above all in their reappearance in new guises in different places and media; in\u00a0their capacity to move, mobilize, and generate new cultural activities\u2019 (Rigney, 2012: 12).<br \/>\nWe focus our attention on the way you can approach the circulation of such a text\u00a0\u2018taking on new guises\u2019: how to transcend the case study in a meaningful and convincing\u00a0manner by using concepts from reception studies, adaptation studies and translation<br \/>\nstudies?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Calvo Gonz\u00e1lez (Universidad Complutense de Madrid) Elckerlijc versus\u00a0Todohombre<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Panel 6A (Dutch)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Het werk Todohombre o el Espejo de la Bienaventuranza is de enige bekende vertaling\u00a0in het Spaans van Elkckerlijk die is verschenen in 1967 door de Spaanse filoloog Felip\u00a0Lorda i Alaiz.

In principe wil ik nagaan hoe de tekst is overgebracht in<br \/>\nde Spaans tekst van Lorda. Bij het hoorspeel zou ik graag willen uitleggen hoe dit is\u00a0bewerkt volgens de Spaanse versie en op welke manier en methode deze tekst\u00a0beantwoordt aan de oorspronkelijke bedoeling van de produktie van de tekst: het\u00a0voorstellen voor een publiek van toeschouwers of toehoorders. Bovendien tracht ik ook<br \/>\neen overzicht te geven van de receptie van de tekst in het Spaanstalig gebied. Voor\u00a0zover het kan in de tijd van de produktie zelf, dus als oorspronkelijke tekst.

Adaptations were, to a degree,\u00a0reinvented in this period, as guarantors of safe, wholesome and educational<br \/>\nentertainment, in an attempt to rescue the movies\u2019 sinking reputation as promoting idle\u00a0and lascivious behaviour. This paper will look at the major adaptations for children in\u00a0this period, from Little Women (1933) to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), and\u00a0the evolving reputation of adaptations in the new era of sound as unadventurous,\u00a0conservative and backward looking, a reputation that persisted for most of the 20th\u00a0century.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Daniel Cunin (Belgium) Translating Hadewijch in the wake of French-speaking\u00a0translators of the 20th century<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Panel 2A (Dutch): Profielen, motieven en strategie\u00ebn van Franstalige Hadewijch-bemiddelaars (1897-2014)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In this talk, translator Daniel Cuninaan will discuss three previous translations of\u00a0Hadewijch\u2019s Liederen (from the edition of V.

Grijp, Groningen,\u00a0Historische Uitgeverij, 2009) in light of his own translation of the work, which he is<br \/>\ncurrently finalising for Paris publisher Albin Michel.<\/p>\n<p>French speaking readers have, all in all, discovered Hadewijch\u2019s Liederen through\u00a0three translations: that of Fran\u00e7ois Closset (1900-1964), that of Jean-Baptiste Porion\u00a0(1899-1987) and that of Rose Vande Plas (Love is All. Strophic Poems, Paris, Pierre T\u00e9qui,<br \/>\n1984). The latter is the only one to offer a French translation of the 45 \u2018Liederen\u2019.\u00a0Nevertheless, the translation by Dom Porion, which remains partial, is still the most\u00a0disseminated and discussed one.<\/p>\n<p>Cunin\u2019s contribution goes beyond a brief overview of the existing works and explains\u00a0why the Porion edition is still eminent. He will also offer a first reflection on the choices\u00a0made by each of the three translators in the light of his own work and progress.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Roberto Dagnino (Universit\u00e9 de Paris 4-Sorbonne) \u2018The Lion\u2019 that arrived late.\u00a0Textual and Contextual Aspects of the only Italian Translation of Hendrik\u00a0Conscience\u2019s De Leeuw van Vlaanderen (1946)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Panel 2B (English)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A recent volume on the translations of Hendrik Conscience\u2019s novels has convincingly\u00a0showed that the \u2018father\u2019 of the Flemish literature was largely appreciated by Italian\u00a0publishers, particularly by the Catholic-oriented among them. It is therefore rather\u00a0surprising that the novel that is currently considered as Conscience\u2019s most famous one,\u00a0De Leeuw van Vlaanderen (1838), was published only once in Italian, in 1946. Although\u00a0this post-war translation appears to be unique, it nonetheless appears to be the result of\u00a0a longer reception history. Selected by a Catholic publisher, translated by a woman,\u00a0included in a series of \u2018good readings\u2019 for a large \u2018unknown public\u2019, Il Leone di Fiandra\u00a0contains several elements fitting the broader picture of the reception of Conscience\u2019s\u00a0novels in Italy in the twentieth century. Although the book includes neither an<br \/>\nintroduction nor a blurb exposing the motives and intentions of the publisher and the\u00a0translator, the translation itself includes a sufficient number of elements allowing us to\u00a0draw some conclusions. The following aspects will be discussed in this paper: ideological\u00a0orientation of the publisher, translation strategies, probable source texts, and the\u00a0(supposed) target readership. This contribution does not only aim at reconstructing De\u00a0Leeuw\u2019s long \u2013 and above all slow \u2013 path to Italy. It also attempts to provide a sample of\u00a0the methodological advantages of combining textual and contextual features for\u00a0historical research in the fields of translation and reception studies.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Michel De Dobbeleer (Ghent University) Down with Capitalism!

Voor het overige kon men de lezer zonder al te veel aanpassingen gewoon\u00a0laten meegenieten van het buitenlandse werk in kwestie. Niemand verplichtte hem om\u00a0de inleiding te lezen, laat staan die tot op de letter te geloven.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Dorien De Man (University of Leuven) An unpretentious story: The non-reception of\u00a0three English translations of Willem Elsschot\u2019s Kaas<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Panel 3A (Dutch): Kaas van Elsschot en zijn buitenlandse afnemers \/ Elsschot\u2019s Kaas and its foreign consumers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In 2002, nearly seventy years after the appearance of Willem Elsschot\u2019s self-declared\u00a0masterpiece Kaas, its first English translation was published. This is not so remarkable as<br \/>\nthe non-English literature, even today, only covers 2% of the Anglophone market.\u00a0Between 1933 and 1989, however, three English translations of Kaas were produced by\u00a0three different translators. All three were translated directly from the original Dutch\u00a0version, but none of them was published. These translations have barely been\u00a0mentioned in the literature, let alone studied. In this paper, I pursue a close analysis of\u00a0the genesis of these translations. The story begins with the British Anthony Gishford, a<br \/>\nfriend of Elisabeth de Roos\u2019s, who in 1930 wrote to Menno ter Braak: \u2018I even translated\u00a0[Kaas] into English, but at that time the idea of there being such a thing as\u00a0contemporary Dutch or Flemish literature appeared nonsensical to English publishers.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Thirty years later, new efforts were undertaken to publish Kaas in English,\u00a0respectively by Professor Renier and father and son Van Riemsdijk, each employed at\u00a0the National Fund for Literature. In 1949, Kaas ended up in the Bibliotheca Flandrica\u00a0series of the Fund, which planned to publish twenty-five important works of Dutch<br \/>\nliterature in English, French and German. Apparently, by then, the English market was\u00a0not ready yet either. Finally, Vernon Pearce, father of the writer Joseph Pearce, made\u00a0another translation of Kaas. He sent some fragments of his translation to Johan\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Anthierens who published them in newspaper De Morgen. Anthierens then called on\u00a0<\/span>experts to peer review and edit the translation, without response.<\/p>\n<p>This translation history brings to the fore different factors ranging from the author\u2019s\u00a0choices, the publishers and the translators to deficiencies in the translation policy of the\u00a0Belgian and Dutch governments in the 50s and 60s.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ma\u0142gorzata Dowlaszewicz (University of Wroc\u0142aw) Sixteenth-century Poland and\u00a0Elckerlijc<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Panel 3B (English): The circulation of Elckerlijc<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The research of the CODL-group shows that the reception of Elckerlijc in many countries,\u00a0including Poland, becomes noticeable especially in two periods. The first period falls in\u00a0the sixteenth century and is connected to the Latin translations of the text whereas the\u00a0second one at the beginning of the twentieth century. I investigate whether apart from\u00a0the literary reasons also the political and ideological ones can be found in the popularity\u00a0of this text in the 16th century outside the Low Countries. This is the Golden Age of\u00a0Polish culture and for the first time the Polish language plays a role in literature. To what\u00a0extent would the popularity of the Latin translations of Elckerlijc (at least three prints in\u00a0Krakow in the 40s of the 16th century) have played a role in the period of the<br \/>\nrevolutionary work of Copernicus and the first Polish poet Rej (who also wrote Kupiec, a\u00a0play based on Mercator)? It is also interesting to investigate what role played two\u00a0printers -Ungler and Wietor? What was the target audience of these two printers and\u00a0what other texts did they publish around that time? The answer to these questions puts\u00a0the text into a political and ideological context of the mid-sixteenth century in Poland\u00a0and can give possible reasons for the popularity of Latin translations of Elckerlijc in\u00a0Poland.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Marijke Meijer Drees (University of Groningen) Linguistic Affinity and Memory:\u00a0Lucifer in South-Africa<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Panel 5B (English): The Splendour of Vondel\u2019s Lucifer 1654-2015: canonicity, cultural memory and cultural\u00a0transfer<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Two adaptations of Vondel\u2019s tragedy Lucifer have been produced and published in South\u00a0Africa: one in the book series entitled Afrikaanse Vondel Uitgawe (1925) and the other\u00a0in the series Vondel vir Suid-Afrika (1968). The contents of these adaptations as well as\u00a0their institutional settings involve strong Dutch-\u2018Afrikaanse\u2019 connections. This\u00a0observation leads to the complex colonial past that South Africa shares with the\u00a0Netherlands. Two pillars of this conjoint past will be taken in consideration: firstly, the\u00a0linguistic affinity between Afrikaans and Dutch, and secondly, the remembrance of the\u00a0so-called \u2018stamverwantschap\u2019 or kinship between the African Boers and the Dutch\u00a0settlers who landed at the Cape in 1652.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jane Fenoulhet (UCL London) &amp; Jaap Grave (Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t\u00a0Munster) Figuring literary translation: Oeroeg into English and German<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Panel 4B (English)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In this presentation we look at Oeroeg by Hella Haasse and its English (The Black Lake,\u00a02013) and German (Der schwarze See, 1994) versions.

Earlier research on the\u00a0two English translations (Fenoulhet, 2012) are ideologically far apart, revealing the\u00a0translator as an \u2018agent of metamorphosis\u2019 and \u2018powerful transformer\u2019, \u2018co-creator of a<br \/>\ntranslated literary text and even as a \u2018pilgrim\u2019 (Michael Cronin, 2000).

In the historical sciences, for instance, De donkere kamer van Damokles played\u00a0a vital role in paradigm shifts. War historians such as Hans Blom and Chris van der\u00a0Heijden have indicated that their scientific views on the German occupation are heavily\u00a0influenced by Hermans\u2019s novel (Kieft 2012). The work is known to have contributed to\u00a0the shift from the traditional black-and-white view on right and wrong to the nowadays-accepted image of a \u2018grey past\u2019 (Van der Heijden 2001).<\/p>\n<p>Using Hermans\u2019s correspondence, we furthermore aim to reconstruct the role the\u00a0author played in the coming into being of some of the translations and to gain an\u00a0impression of his evaluation of the results.

In the first\u00a0version, it is a case of pure communist propaganda, in which Multatuli\u2019s novel is seen\u00a0only as a possible weapon in the struggle against imperialism. In the 1967 edition, the\u00a0ideological component becomes weaker. Now the novel is presented as a work dealing\u00a0with personal life experiences, but in addition also as a product of literary reception.\u00a0Multatuli is no longer seen as a social, but rather as a literary reformer.<\/p>\n<p>The difference between the two approaches reflects the developments that took\u00a0place in Romanian state ideology after 1964, when a relative thaw in the politicalcultural\u00a0sphere made possible the resumption of the debate on ways of literary<br \/>\nreception. It will be concluded that the Romanian version of Max Havelaar published in\u00a01967 is of value not only because it was translated directly from the Dutch, but also\u00a0because the introduction demonstrates its triumph over the earlier simplistic<br \/>\ninterpretation of the novel as a disguised ideological treatise.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Frits van Oostrom (University of Utrecht) Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Keynote 6 (Dutch)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Franco Paris (Universita \u2018L\u2019Orientale\u2019) Bemiddeling als een vorm van engagement:\u00a0de rol van de literair vertaler<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Panel 4A (Dutch)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Vooral met een kleinere taal als het Nederlands, is de individuele<br \/>\ndocent\/vertaler\/intellectueel meer geneigd \u2013 soms genoodzaakt \u2013 om een rol te gaan\u00a0spelen als cultureel bemiddelaar en literair promotor, aangezien de buitenlandse\u00a0uitgeverijen en media vaak geen directe toegang hebben tot de oorspronkelijke tekst.<br \/>\nRekening houdend met de complexiteit van het literaire veld, wil ik de nadruk leggen op\u00a0het feit dat zulke individuele initiatieven, mede door de Weltanschauung van de\u00a0bemiddelaar, een fundamentele rol spelen bij de verspreiding en receptie van\u00a0Nederlandstalige literatuur in het buitenland.

Reception in\u00a0Sweden differed largely from that in Norway: the novel was positively reviewed and\u00a0critics compared Hermans to similar, well-known Swedish writers like Lars Gustafsson\u00a0and Artur Lundkvist. The relatively small impact of World War II on the country is likely\u00a0to be responsible for this, as Sweden had in fact remained neutral in the War.<\/p>\n<p>The hypothesis of a correlation between the impact of the War on a country and the\u00a0reception of the novel receives more support when we examine the German reception\u00a0history. In the 1960s the novel was not translated into German, due to a lack of interest\u00a0in novels situated in the War. As late as 2001 the first German edition of De donkere\u00a0kamer van Damokles was published. It sold well and received critical acclaim. A possible\u00a0explanation is that the \u2018grey\u2019 depiction of wartime matched quite well with the progress\u00a0in the on-going processing of collective trauma in Germany.

Nevertheless, it is still\u00a0impressive that the play was staged during three different regimes: the Habsburg\u00a0monarchy (until 1918), the democratic Czechoslovakia (1918-1939) and the socialist\u00a0Czechoslovakia (after 1948).<\/p>\n<p>Especially the last period deserves attention as everything was subject to\u00a0censorship.

One would suppose easily that the<br \/>\ncritical note was the most dominant in all reviews and that it was the reason that three\u00a0different theatre companies had chosen the play for new adaptations (1948, 1956,\u00a01973).

Ideological elements in the reception history of some translations of<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong> Willem Frederik Hermans\u2019 novel De donkere kamer van Damokles<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Despite his appreciation for French culture and his desire to become part of it with his\u00a0own oeuvre, Hermans was reportedly shocked by the first French translation of his\u00a0novel, by the Fleming Maurice Beerblock. This story, however, has recently been<br \/>\nnuanced by Van de Sterre (2007) and Fransen (2005): after initial agreement, Hermans\u00a0changed his opinion when he experienced his novel did nothing in France. In 2006, a\u00a0second French translation appeared, this time by Dani\u00ebl Cunin, and it seemed to do\u00a0hardly better than the first one. With the exception of one positive review in the Swiss\u00a0Le Temps, the novel remained unnoticed, until it was picked up by Milan Kundera, who\u00a0praised this \u2018oeuvre capitale, pourtant pass\u00e9e inaper\u00e7ue\u2019 late January 2007 on page two\u00a0of the influential newspaper Le Monde.<\/p>\n<p>In the reception of both the original Dutch novel and Cunin\u2019s translation, it is striking\u00a0that so many critics, despite the gap of half a century that lies in between, focus on the\u00a0ideological aspects of the novel, often leading to similar conclusions. In this contribution<br \/>\nKundera\u2019s enthusiasm for Hermans\u2019s novel is further examined by focusing on the\u00a0translation of the heterolinguistic aspects of De donkere kamer van Damokles. To what\u00a0extent does the translation of a text that is rooted in a literary discourse to which the\u00a0text attributes a certain degree of otherness (Suchet 2014) inspire an ideologically based\u00a0reading of the text, even decades later? In parallel, the representativeness of Kundera\u2019s\u00a0judgement in comparison to other reviews of the novel in \u2018late postmodern\u2019 France is\u00a0scrutinized.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cora-Lisa S\u00fct\u0151 (K\u00e1roli G\u00e1sp\u00e1r Protestant University) Drie keer Sajt: enkele\u00a0bijzonderheden over de verschillende Hongaarse vertalingen van Kaas en de vorm\u00a0en context waarin ze verschenen<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Panel 3A (Dutch): Kaas van Elsschot en zijn buitenlandse afnemers \/ Elsschot\u2019s Kaas and its foreign consumers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Elsschots Kaas has been translated (partly or completely) into Hungarian no less than\u00a0three times.

De reden waarom De\u00a0helaasheid der dingen in Tsjechi\u00eb ongepubliceerd bleef is niet de omstreden kwaliteit\u00a0van de vertaling van het fragment, maar veel eerder de ontbrekende verankering van de moderne Vlaamse letteren in het Tsjechische literaire veld en het gebrek aan\u00a0institutionele druk in de vorm van een stelselmatige stimulans.<\/p>\n<p>In 2009 heeft het Vlaams Fonds voor de Letteren wel een campagne onder de\u00a0Tsjechische uitgevers gevoerd, wat direct daarop tot publicatie van enkele Vlaamse\u00a0auteurs leidt.

The question of how professional Dutch theater makers used this late<br \/>\nmedieval morality tale after its rediscovery in the nineteenth century to promulgate new\u00a0theater ideals, new ideas about performativity, is central to this contribution. Numerous<br \/>\nDutch theater troupes played this allegory in the Netherlands and Flanders, but also in\u00a0South Africa, the Dutch Indies, Venezuela, and Surinam. In this research, which is\u00a0concerned primarily with Dutch theater history, I study the reception history of medieval<br \/>\nnarrative materials in the modern age (medievalism). In what way did the avant-gardist\u00a0theater use the Elckerlyc as possibility to bring new theater ideals into practice with\u00a0medieval narrative material? I also use an intermedial and intertextual approach. Every<br \/>\nElckerlyc adaptation entered into a dialogue with, referred to, and literally used other\u00a0Elckerlycs, such as an edition of the Middle Dutch text itself or a twentieth-century\u00a0adaptation. From this it follows that research into modern productions of this late<br \/>\nmedieval morality play moves into the field of media studies. This field incorporates the\u00a0medial and material aspects of a performance, trying to discover how these aspects\u00a0affect the way in which a text is received within a specific social-historical context.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Yves T\u2019Sjoen (Universiteit Gent\/Universiteit Stellenbosch) &amp; Ren\u00e9e Marais\u00a0(University of Pretoria), Oeroeg in South Africa<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Panel 2B (English)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In 1987, as part of the series \u2018Literatuur van die Lae Lande\u2019 [Literature of the Low\u00a0Countries], Academica (Pretoria\/Cape Town) published an edition of Oeroeg with an\u00a0introduction and glossary by Tony Links and Wium van Zyl.

He discusses the classical features of Schmidt\u2019s work and studies how these are\u00a0in constant interaction with the context. That context includes both production,\u00a0distribution and reception, crystallized in particular actors and institutions within the<br \/>\nliterary field. Particular attention will be paid to translations and adaptations that\u00a0convert the text into another language or form. Researchers like Linda Hutcheon (2006)\u00a0suggest that adaptations can both confirm and strengthen the status of a classic by<br \/>\nreviving it. Translations (of the book or of adaptations) can ensure that a literary work\u00a0enters the international canon.

M. van der Zeyde<br \/>\n(Utrecht 1934) studied Hadewijch as a personality and writer, whereas M. van der Kallen\u00a0(Nijmegen 1934) and E. Allard (Nijmegen 1936) focused on linguistic aspects of her\u00a0works. In poetry Hadewijch was hardly described in those years.<\/p>\n<p>In Flanders, however, Hadewijch became a model of a militant woman. This can be\u00a0demonstrated by several lectures of Cyriel Verschaeve. Hadewijch\u2019s role in the\u00a0development of vulgar speech (Diets) got also more attention in Flanders than in The<br \/>\nNetherlands.<\/p>\n<p>Political and ideological facts played a part in that difference.
