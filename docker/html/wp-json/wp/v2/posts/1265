Cartmell went on to relate this to female characters in Disney animated films (enter Snow White, whose charms could redden the cheeks of even the most crotchety of old men, Grumpy). Disney\u2019s figuring of animated characters (Snow White) after real-life stars (Shirley Temple), Cartmell emphasised, can be seen as a deliberate strategy to exploit the duplicitous code-era visual politics of morality and male desire and, in so doing, beat Hollywood at its own game \u2013 and this in lieu of pursuing other, more modern, code-breaking avenues.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>\u2018All but one of the authors being discussed at this conference are dead\u2019<\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.codl.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/foto15.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1276\" alt=\"foto15\" src=\"http:\/\/www.codl.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/foto15.jpg\" width=\"432\" height=\"278\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.codl.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/foto15.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.codl.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/foto15-300x192.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>After parallel-running panels on youth adaptations of Conscience&#8217;s <i>De leeuw van Vlaanderen <\/i>and the reception history of Hermans\u2019 <i>De donkere kamer van Damocles<\/i>, the full conference reconvened for a presentation by Arno Ku<ins cite=\"mailto:R%C3%A9thelyi%20Orsolya\" datetime=\"2015-06-08T15:22\">i<\/ins>pers of the National Library and Marlies Hoff of the Dutch Foundation for Literature on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.letterenfonds.nl\/en\/authors-and-translators\"><b>digital databases<\/b><\/a> of translated Dutch literature.<\/p>\n<p>This was followed by a round-table discussion on the<b> role of mediators<\/b> in the worldwide circulation of Dutch-language literature.

Wilterdink probed book reviews published about Dutch literature in German, French, British and American newspapers to gauge the reception of Dutch literature abroad.<\/p>\n<p>His results show steadily increasing press coverage across the board, fueled by a growing number of translated titles. Germany stands out as the only national press with both a developed conception of and taste for Dutch literature, even occasionally holding Dutch writers up as examples to be followed by its own national writers. Alternatively, in French, British and American newspapers, a coherent image of Dutch literature <i>in se<\/i> has thus far failed to materialise \u2013 the French are well-meaning but superficial, the British preoccupied with their own writers, the Americans ignorant. When Dutch writers did make the papers, emphasis tended to be placed on their individual merits, removed from any connection to a Dutch literary tradition.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.codl.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/foto44.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1279\" alt=\"foto44\" src=\"http:\/\/www.codl.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/foto44.jpg\" width=\"432\" height=\"270\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.codl.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/foto44.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.codl.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/foto44-300x187.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">Nico Wilterdink<\/h5>\n<p>Wilterdink went on to describe changes in the literary and cultural world system resulting from the rise of English as the unrivalled world language after World War II, which shifted the centre of power in the global literary field away from Paris and toward the United States. This shift, in turn, gave credence to the United States\u2019 centrist and universalist tendencies and tastes (if an international author is worth reading, his work will de facto find its way to the United States), which continues to have important consequences for the reception of Dutch literature today. One such consequence: many Dutch writers are stigmatised from the get-go due to their \u2018funny\u2019 names.

Arguing for a change of focus away from collective schemes and structures (cf. Toury\u2019s model for Descriptive Translation Studies), Meylaerts emphasised the importance of studying cultural transfer at the level of the individual mediator. She unpacked the idea of the (inter)cultural mediator, who is part author (often writing in multiple languages), (self-)translator, publicist, artistic\/institutional mediator, collaborator and even plagiarist, all at the same time (e.g. Georges Eekhoud, Stijn Streuvels, Gaston Pulings). An actor- and process-oriented perspective, urged Meylaerts, is uniquely equipped to tease out these complex forms of transfer, which are especially active in small, linguistically fluid literatures.<\/p>\n<p>Friday afternoon continued with two more rounds of parallel-running panels, including papers presented on Elsschot\u2019s <i>Kaas<\/i>, <i>Elckerlijc<\/i>, Verhulst\u2019s <i>De helaasheid der dingen<\/i>, Haasse\u2019s <i>Oeroeg<\/i>, Couperus\u2019 <i>De stille kracht<\/i> and a paper on the role of the literary translators as mediators.

Van Oostrom targeted technology as a crucial tool that must be leveraged if scholars in the humanities are to successfully counter the image that \u201cwe are all just ruminating old stuff\u201d. He urged the audience to \u201ccreate digital campfires\u201d and embrace open access when disseminating research results. \u201cInternationalisation has opened exciting new avenues of investigation and creativity,\u201d concluded van Oostrom. \u201cThe international study of Dutch literature is thriving.\u201d<br \/>\nAnd with that, all that remained was the formal closing of the conference.
